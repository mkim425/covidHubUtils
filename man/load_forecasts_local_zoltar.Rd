\title{Load all available forecasts submitted on \code{forecast_dates} from local Zoltar module.}
\usage{
load_forecasts_local_zoltar(
  models = NULL,
  forecast_dates = NULL,
  locations = NULL,
  types = NULL,
  targets = NULL,
  as_of = NULL,
  hub = c("US", "ECDC"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  local_zoltpy_path,
  zoltar_sqlite_file
)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{Character vector of model abbreviations.
Default all models that submitted forecasts meeting the other criteria.}

\item{forecast_dates}{A 2 dimensional list of forecast dates to retrieve forecasts.
This function will return the latest forecasts
for each sub-list of dates.
Default to  \code{NULL} which would include all valid forecast dates in Zoltar.}

\item{locations}{list of fips. Default to all locations with available forecasts in Zoltar.}

\item{types}{Character vector specifying type of forecasts to load: \code{"quantile"}
and/or \code{"point"}. Default to all valid forecast types in Zoltar.}

\item{targets}{character vector of targets to retrieve, for example
\code{c('1 wk ahead cum death', '2 wk ahead cum death')}.
Default to all valid targets in Zoltar.}

\item{as_of}{character for date time to load forecasts submitted as of this time.
It could use the format of one of the three examples:
\verb{"2021-01-01", "2020-01-01 01:01:01" and "2020-01-01 01:01:01 UTC".}
If you would like to set a timezone, it has to be UTC now.
If not, helper function will append the default timezone to your input based on \code{hub} parameter.
Default to \code{NULL} to load the latest version.}

\item{hub}{character vector, where the first element indicates the hub
from which to load forecasts. Possible options are \code{"US"} and \code{"ECDC"}.}

\item{verbose}{logical for printing messages on zoltar job status. Default to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{local_zoltpy_path}{path to local clone of \code{zolpy} repository.}

\item{zoltar_sqlite_file}{path to local sqlite file,
either a relative path w.r.t. \code{local_zoltpy_path} or an absolute path.}
}
\value{
data.frame with columns \code{model}, \code{forecast_date}, \code{location}, \code{horizon},
\code{temporal_resolution}, \code{target_variable}, \code{target_end_date}, \code{type}, \code{quantile}, \code{value},
\code{location_name}, \code{population}, \code{geo_type}, \code{geo_value}, \code{abbreviation}

Please follow instructions to set up required environment prior to using this function
for the first time

\details{
\itemize{
\item This function will throw an error when no forecasts are submitted on
any dates in \code{forecast_dates} for selected \code{models},
\code{locations}, \code{types} and \code{target}.
\item By default. \code{test-load_forecasts_local_zoltar()} is skipped. Please modify
\code{local_zoltpy_path} and \code{zoltar_sqlite_file} on top of the unit test file to run tests.
